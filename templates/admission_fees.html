                                <p>The procedure for admission requires the child to be registered for admission. After registration the children are to undergo an admission test and interview and then are finally selected for admission. </p>
                                <p>Vacancies generally occur in the month of February, in Classes I to VIII only. A few admissions are obtainable, subject to availability of seats in classes IX and XI as well. </p>
                                 <p>Admissions are offered based on the performance of the child in the admission test, giving due preference to NRI admissions, brothers and sisters of past and present Pinegrovians, children of serving defence personnel and war widows and extremely brilliant scholarship/free-ship students of the poorer section of society. Details of the procedure are explained hereafter.</p>
