    <p class="text-justify">

    <p>A famous adage advocates as follows: "The future of a country is made or unmade in its classrooms"...
        One cannot undermine the importance of classroom teaching vis other activities but they definitely have a
        very important role to play. The primary objective is to impart high-quality academic tutoring so that the
        pupils may perform well in academics and the secondary and tertiary aims are to involve the children in various
        games and other co-curricular activities.</p>
    <p>In a residential school <b>'activities' </b> find an equal if not more important place in curriculum development.
        All requisite infrastructures are available in Pinegrove School, to provide the children with the facilities
        needed for <b>"Quality"</b> education.</p>

        <h4>Organization for Activities:</h4>
        <p> All the students, both boys and girls, are divided into four Houses, <span style="background-color:yellow;">
            Arcadia </span>  (Yellow) ,  <span style="background-color:green;">Astro City</span>(Green),
            <span style="background-color:red;"> Batbunker  </span> (Red) and <span style="background-color:violet;">
                Dream Land  </span>  (Violet). Each house is looked after by a House Master/Mistress who in turn is
            assisted by the student prefects. All teachers are also allocated Houses.</p>
        <p>The prefect system is an essential part of a residential school for delegating responsibility to children
            so that they learn to exercise initiative.</p>
        <p>The houses have been named keeping in view the need for making the children love nature and become
            environmentally conscious.</p>
